        <h1 class="title">What Is A Poem And How Do You Write One?</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">A poem is a piece of writing in which the words are chosen for
        their beauty and sound. Poets choose words for their meaning
        and acoustics, arranging them to create a tempo known as the
        meter. Some poems incorporate rhyme schemes with two or more
        lines that end in like-sounding words. On this page, I will
        explain how to write a poem from scratch.</p>

    </div>

        <h2 class="title">Part 1: Starting the Poem</h2>

        <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5e/Write-a-Poem-Step-1-Version-4.jpg/aid2375-v4-728px-Write-a-Poem-Step-1-Version-4.jpg.webp" alt="Do writing exercises" class="center">

        <p class="paragraph"><b>1. Do writing exercises.</b> A poem might start as a snippet of a verse,
        a line or two that seems to come out of nowhere, or an image you
        cannot get out of your head. You can find inspiration for your
        poem by doing writing exercises and using the world around you.
        Once you have inspiration, you can then shape and mould your
        thoughts into a poem.</p>

        <div id="smallSquare" class="smallParagraph">

            <h3 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Brainstorming for Ideas</h3>

            <p><b>Try a free write.</b> Grab a notebook or your computer and just
            start writing—about your day, your feelings, or how you don’t
            know what to write about. Let your mind wander for 5-10 minutes
            and see what you can come up with.</p>

            <p><b>Write to a prompt.</b> Look up poem prompts online or come up with
            your own, like "what water feels like" or "how it feels to get
            bad news." Write down whatever comes to mind and see where it
            takes you.</p>

            <p><b>Make a list or mind map of images.</b> Think about a situation
            that’s full of emotion for you and write down a list of images
            or ideas that you associate with it. You could also write about
            something you see right in front of you, or take a walk and note
            down things you see.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>2. Get inspired by your environment and those close to you.</b> Inspiration
        for a great poem is all around you, even if you don’t see it just yet.
        Think of every memory, situation and moment as a possible topic and
        you’ll start seeing poetry all around you!</p>

        <div id="smallSquare" class="smallParagraph">

            <h3 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Finding a Topic</h3>

            <p><b>Go for a walk.</b> Head to your
            favorite park or spot in the city, or just take a walk through
            your neighborhood. Use the people you see and nature and
            buildings you pass as inspiration for a poem.</p>

            <p><b>Write about someone you care about.</b> Think about someone who’s
            really important to you, like a parent or your best friend.
            Recall a special moment you shared with them and use it to
            form a poem that shows that you care about them.</p>

            <p><b>Pick a memory you have strong feelings about.</b> Close your eyes,
            clear your head, and see what memories come to the forefront
            of your mind. Pay attention to what emotions they bring up for
            you—positive or negative—and probe into those. Strong emotional
            moments make for beautiful, interesting poems.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>3. Pick a specific theme or idea.</b> You can start your poem by focusing on a
        specific theme or idea that you find fascinating. Picking a specific
        theme or idea to focus on in the poem can give your poem a clear goal or
        objective. This can make it easier for you to narrow down what images
        and descriptions you are going to use in your poem.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>For example, you may decide to write a poem around the theme
            of "love and friendship." You may then think about specific moments
            in your life where you experienced love and friendship as well as
            how you would characterize love and friendship based on your
            relationships with others.</li>

            <li>Try to be specific when you choose a theme or idea, as this
            can help your poem feel less vague or unclear. For example, rather
            than choosing the general theme of "loss," you may choose the more
            specific theme, such as "loss of a child" or "loss of a best friend."</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>4. Choose a poetic form.</b> Get your creative juices
        flowing by picking a form for your poem. There are many different poetic
        forms that you can use, from free verse to sonnet to rhyming couplet.
        You may go for a poetic form that you find easy to use, such as free verse,
        or a form that you find more challenging, such as a sonnet. Choose one
        poetic form and stick to that structure so your poem feels cohesive to your
        reader.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>You may decide to try a poetic form that is short, such as the haiku,
            the cinquain, or the shape poem. You could then play around with the
            poetic form and have fun with the challenges of a particular form. Try
            rearranging words to make your poem sound interesting.</li>

            <li>You may opt for a form that is more funny and playful, such as the
            limerick form, if you are trying to write a funny poem. Or you may
            go for a more lyrical form like the sonnet, the ballad, or the
            rhyming couplet for a poem that is more dramatic and romantic.</li>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>5. Read examples of poetry.</b> To get a better sense of what
        other poets are writing, you may look through examples of poetry. You
        may read poems written in the same poetic form you are interested in or
        poems about themes or ideas that you find inspiring. You may also choose
        poems that are well known and considered "classics" to get a better sense
        of the genre. For example, you may read:</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>"Kubla Khan" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</li>

            <li>"Song of Myself" by Walt Whitman</li>

            <li>"I measure every Grief I meet" by Emily Dickinson</li>

            <li>"Sonnet 18" by William Shakespeare</li>

            <li>"One Art" by Elizabeth Bishop</li>

            <li>"Night Funeral in Harlem" by Langston Hughes</li>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>1. Use concrete imagery.</b> Avoid abstract
        imagery and go for concrete descriptions of people, places,
        and things in your poem. You should always try to describe
        something using the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight,
        and sound. Using concrete imagery will immerse your reader in
        the world of your poem and make images come alive for them.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>For example, rather than try to describe a feeling or image
            with abstract words, use concrete words instead. Rather than
            write, "I felt happy," you may use concrete words to create a
            concrete image, such as, "My smile lit up the room like wildfire."</li>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>2. Include literary devices.</b> Literary devices like
        metaphor and simile add variety and depth to your poetry. Using these
        devices can make your poem stand out to your reader and allow you to
        paint a detailed picture for your reader. Try to use literary devices
        throughout your poem, varying them so you do not use only metaphors or
        only similes in your writing.</p>

        <div id="smallSquare" class="smallParagraph">

            <h3 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Try a New Literary Device</h3>

            <p><b>Metaphor:</b> This device compares one thing to
            another in a surprising way. A metaphor is a
            great way to add unique imagery and create an
            interesting tone. Example: "I was a bird on a
            wire, trying not to look down."</p>

            <p><b>Simile:</b> Similes compare two things using "like" or
            "as." They might seem interchangeable with metaphors,
            but both create a different flow and rhythm you can
            play with. Example: "She was as alone as a crow in a
            field," or "My heart is like an empty stage."</p>

            <p><b>Personification:</b> If you personify an object or idea, you’re
            describing it by using human qualities or attributes. This can
            clear up abstract ideas or images that are hard to visualize.
            Example: "The wind breathed in the night."</p>

            <p><b>Alliteration:</b> Alliteration occurs when you use words in quick
            succession that begin with the same letter. This is a great tool
            if you want to play with the way your poem sounds. Example: "Lucy
            let her luck linger."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>3. Write for the ear.</b> Poetry is made to be read out
        loud and you should write your poem with a focus on how it sounds on
        the page. Writing for the ear will allow you to play with the structure
        of your poem and your word choice. Notice how each line of your poem flows
        into one another and how placing one word next to another creates a certain
        sound</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>For example, you may notice how the word "glow" sounds compared to
            the word "glitter." "Glow" has an "ow" sound, which conjures an image
            of warmth and softness to the listener. The word "glitter" is two syllables
            and has a more pronounced "tt" sound. This word creates a sharper, more
            rhythmic sound for the listener.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>4. Avoid cliche.</b> Your poetry will be much stronger if you
        avoid cliches, which are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost
        their meaning. Go for creative descriptions and images in your poem so your
        reader is surprised and intrigued by your writing. If you feel a certain phrase
        or image will be too familiar to your reader, replace it with a more unique
        phrase.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>For example, you may notice you have used the cliche, "she was as busy as a bee"
            to describe a person in your poem. You may replace this cliche with a more unique
            phrase, such as "her hands were always occupied" or "she moved through the kitchen at
            a frantic pace."</li>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>1. Read the poem out loud.</b> Once you have completed a draft of the poem,
        you should read it aloud to yourself. Notice how the words sound on the page. Pay attention
        to how each line of your poem flows into the next. Keep a pen close by so you can mark any
        lines or words that sound awkward or jumbled.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
            
            <li>You may also read the poem out loud to others, such as friends, family, or a partner. Have them
            respond to the poem on the initial listen and notice if they seem confused or unclear about certain
            phrases or lines.</li>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>2. Get feedback from others.</b> You can also share your poem with other poets to get feedback
        from them and improve your poem. You may join a poetry writing group, where you workshop your poems with other
        poets and work on your poetry together. Or you may take a poetry writing class where you work with an instructor
        and other aspiring poets to improve your writing. You can then take the feedback you receive from your peers and
        use it in your revision of the poem.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>3. Revise your poem.</b> Once you have received feedback on your poem, you should revise it until it
        is at its best. Use feedback from others to cut out any lines to feel confusing or unclear. Be willing to "kill your
        darlings" and not hold onto pretty lines just for the sake of including them in the poem. Make sure every line of
        the poem contributes to the overall goal, theme, or idea of the poem.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">

            <li>You may go over the poem with a fine-tooth comb and remove any cliches or familiar phrases. You should also make
            sure spelling and grammar in the poem are correct.</li>

                at online images of nature, or your own photos from a visit to a park or the countryside. Write
                down a list or mind map of words that are inspired by thinking about nature. Include your emotions.
                Then use this brainstorming preparation to write your poem, basing it on how nature makes you feel,

            That floats on high o’er vales and hills,<br>
            When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
            A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
            Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
            Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
            <br>
            Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
            And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
            They stretched in never-ending line<br>
            Along the margin of a bay:<br>
            Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
            Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
            <br>
            The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
            Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
            A poet could not but be gay,<br>
            In such a jocund company:<br>
            I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
            What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
            <br>
            For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
            In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
            They flash upon that inward eye<br>
            Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
            And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
            And dances with the daffodils.<br>
        </p>
